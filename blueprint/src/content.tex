\section{Normality and Ultraweak Continuity}

In what follows, let $M$ be a $W^{*}$--algebra. Let $\mathcal{P}(M)$
denote the projection lattice of $M$. Let $\varphi$ be a positive linear functional $\varphi$ on $M$.
We say $\varphi$ is \textbf{normal} if whenever $(p_{\alpha})$ is an increasing net of projections in $M$ with supremum $p$,
we have $\varphi(p_{\alpha})\to \varphi(p)$. In this section we show that this property is equivalent to 
$\sigma(M, M_{*})$--continuity. We say that a linear functional $\varphi$ on $M$
is \textbf{positive} if $\varphi(x)\ge 0$ whenever $x\ge 0$.

\textit{To do : Net results must be replaced by filter versions.}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: selfadjoint_le_norm}
  For all self-adjoint $x\in M$, $\|x\|1-x \ge 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: proj_sub_of_subproj}
  For all $p,q\in \mathcal{P}(M)$ such that $q\le p$, $p-q\in \mathcal{P}(M)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: proj_of_sup_proj}
  For every increasing bounded net $(p_{\alpha})$ of projections in $M$, the supremum $p$
  is a projection in $\mathcal{M}$
\end{lemma}

If $P:\mathcal{P}(M)\to \text{Prop}$ is a predicate, the usual ordering ``$\le$'' on projections
induces an order on the set $\{p\in \mathcal{P}(M)|P(p)\}$. In what follows there will be no confusion if 
we also denote this induced order by ``$\le$''.

The following lemma undoubtedly exists in Mathlib in more generality already.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: uw_pos_sep_pts}
For every nonzero element $a\in M$, there is a $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous positive linear
functional $\psi$ on $M$ such that $\psi(a)\ne 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: exists_uw_ge_normal}
  For every positive normal linear functional $\varphi$ and nonzero $p\in \mathcal{P}(M)$
  there exists a positive $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous linear functional $\psi$ such that $\varphi(p)<\psi(p)$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: msr_th_lemma}
For all positive linear functionals $\varphi,\psi$ with
$\varphi$ normal and $\psi$ $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous and every nonzero $p\in \mathcal{P}(M)$
such that $\varphi(p)<\psi(p)$, there exists a nonzero $p_1 \in \mathcal{P}(M)$ such that $p_1\le p$ and for all 
$q\in \mathcal{P}(M)$ with $q\le p$, we have $\varphi(q)<\phi(q)$. 
\end{lemma}

Recall that a compact Hausdorff space is \textbf{Stonean} if the closure of every open set is open.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: fin_lin_approx_of_stonean}
  Let $K$ be Stonean. Then every element $a$ in $C(K)$ can be uniformly approximated by 
  finite linear combinations of projections in $C(K)$.
\begin{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem: spec_masa_wstar_stonean}
  If $C$ is any maximal commutative $C^*$--subalgebra of a $W^{*}$--algebra $M$, its
  spectrum space (maximal ideal space) is Stonean.
\end{lemma}



\section{Continuous functional calculus}

\begin{definition}[Continuous functional calculus]
  \label{def:continuous_functional_calculus}
  \lean{ContinuousFunctionalCalculus}
  \mathlibok
  A $*$-$R$-algebra is said to have a continuous functional calculus for elements satisfying a predicate $p$ if,
  for each $a$ satisfying $p$, there is a $*$-homomorphism $\phi_a : C(\spectrum[R]{a}, R) \to A$ sending the identity function to $a$, and which is a closed embedding.
  Moreover, $\spectrum[R]{a}$ is compact and nonempty, and $\phi_a$ satisfies the spectral mapping property (i.e., $\spectrum[R]{\phi_a(f)} = f(\spectrum[R]{a})$).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:gelfand_cfc_iso}
  \lean{continuousFunctionalCalculus}
  \mathlibok
  For every normal element $a$ in a unital $C^*$-algebra $A$ there is a $*$-isomorphism between $C(\spectrum{a}, ℂ)$ and the $C^*$-subalgebra of $A$ generated by $a$.
\end{theorem}
