\section{Normality and Ultraweak Continuity}

In what follows, let $M$ be a $W^{*}$--algebra. Let $\mathcal{P}(M)$
denote the projection lattice of $M$. Let $\varphi$ be a positive linear functional $\varphi$ on $M$.
We say $\varphi$ is \textbf{normal} if whenever $(p_{\alpha})$ is an increasing net of projections in $M$ with supremum $p$,
we have $\varphi(p_{\alpha})\to \varphi(p)$. In this section we show that this property is equivalent to 
$\sigma(M, M_{*})$--continuity. We say that a linear functional $\varphi$ on $M$
is \textbf{positive} if $\varphi(x)\ge 0$ whenever $x\ge 0$.

\textit{Note : Nets must be replaced by filters.}

\begin{lemma}
  For all self-adjoint $x\in M$, $\|x\|1-x \ge 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  For all $p,q\in \mathcal{P}(M)$ such that $q\le p$, $p-q\in \mathcal{P}(M)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  For every increasing bounded net $(p_{\alpha})$ of projections in $M$, the supremum $p$
  is a projection in $\mathcal{M}$
\end{lemma}

If $P:\mathcal{P}(M)\to \text{Prop}$ is a predicate, the usual ordering ``$\le$'' on projections
induces an order on the set $\{p\in \mathcal{P}(M)|P(p)\}$. In what follows there will be no confusion if 
we also denote this induced order by ``$\le$''.

\begin{lemma}
  For every positive normal linear functional $\varphi$ and nonzero $p\in \mathcal{P}(M)$
  there exists a positive $\sigma(M,M_{*})$--continuous linear function $\psi$ such that $\varphi(p)<\psi(p)$
\end{lemma}




\section{Continuous functional calculus}

\begin{definition}[Continuous functional calculus]
  \label{def:continuous_functional_calculus}
  \lean{ContinuousFunctionalCalculus}
  \mathlibok
  A $*$-$R$-algebra is said to have a continuous functional calculus for elements satisfying a predicate $p$ if,
  for each $a$ satisfying $p$, there is a $*$-homomorphism $\phi_a : C(\spectrum[R]{a}, R) \to A$ sending the identity function to $a$, and which is a closed embedding.
  Moreover, $\spectrum[R]{a}$ is compact and nonempty, and $\phi_a$ satisfies the spectral mapping property (i.e., $\spectrum[R]{\phi_a(f)} = f(\spectrum[R]{a})$).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Non-unital continuous functional calculus]
  \label{def:nonunital_continuous_functional_calculus}
  \lean{ContinuousFunctionalCalculus}
  \mathlibok
  A non-unital $*$-$R$-algebra is said to have a non-unital continuous functional calculus for elements satisfying a predicate $p$ if,
  for each $a$ satisfying $p$, there is a non-unital $*$-homomorphism $\phi_a : C(\quasispectrum[R]{a}, R)_0 \to A$ (here $C(\quasispectrum[R]{a}, R)_0$ is the collection of functions vanishing at zero on the quasispectrum) sending the identity function to $a$, and which is a closed embedding.
  Moreover, $\quasispectrum[R]{a}$ is compact (it's always nonempty because it contains $0$), and $\phi'_a$ satisfies the spectral mapping property (i.e., $\quasispectrum[R]{\phi'_a(f)} = f(\quasispectrum[R]{a})$).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:cfc}
  \lean{cfc}
  \mathlibok
  \uses{def:continuous_functional_calculus}
  Given $a \in A$ satisfying $p$ and $f : R → R$ continuous on $\spectrum[R]{a}$, we define $f(a) := \phi'_a(f)$ (and we give it a junk value of zero when either $a$ does not satisfy $p$ or $f$ is not continuous on the spectrum).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:cfcₙ}
  \lean{cfcₙ}
  \mathlibok
  \uses{def:nonunital_continuous_functional_calculus}
  Given $a \in A$ satisfying $p$ and $f : R → R$ continuous on $\spectrum[R]{a}$ and $f(0) = 0$, we define $f(a) := \phi'_a(f)$ (and we give it a junk value of zero when and of the conditions on $a$ and $f$ are not met).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:gelfand_cfc_iso}
  \lean{continuousFunctionalCalculus}
  \mathlibok
  For every normal element $a$ in a unital $C^*$-algebra $A$ there is a $*$-isomorphism between $C(\spectrum{a}, ℂ)$ and the $C^*$-subalgebra of $A$ generated by $a$.
\end{theorem}
